        <h1>Design Thinking Project: ADi</h1>
        <p>
            The ADi project focuses on enhancing the dining experience for UTM students and staff. 
            It features a comprehensive app prototype that includes personalized meal recommendations, 
            online ordering, and food tracking. The project employs AI to assist restaurant managers, 
            riders, and customers, making it a seamless ecosystem for dining. Additionally, the 
            project tackles common user pain points like unclear restaurant hours, lack of menus, 
            and navigation difficulties.
